I am eager to take a deeper dive into the inner workings of OSs and various computer systems. I greatly benefitted from CIT593, because it dispelled much of the mystery behind the blackbox (computer) I had been using for decades but never really understood. I am particularly excited for the section of the class that will cover distributed computer systems and network communications, because I have always been curioushow it works. My experience setting up my VM was more challenging than expected. I suspect it was due to mylaptop, but I found there were many steps not included in the instructions for Windows users. I found myself relying on forums, youtube tutorials, and many other outside sources to finally get my Vagrant VM working. I even had to upgrade my Windows 10 version.
